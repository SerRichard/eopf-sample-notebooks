# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository contains Jupyter
notebooks that demonstrate usage examples for the latest generation of ESA
EOPF data product formats and the various libraries to utilize them.
To ensure consistency and readability, please adhere to the following
guidelines.

## Code Style and Formatting

### General Formatting

- Use **Black** (with default settings) for automatic code formatting.
